# NXS

NXS is a Julia module to implement functionality relevant for the analysis of data from neutron and x-ray scattering instruments. 
It is currently aimed mostly toward triple-axis neutron scattering instruments but there is little preventing extending it fully to other neutron scattering instrument types 
or x-ray/electron scattering instrument types.
